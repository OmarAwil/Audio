Audio Player Program

This Java program allows you to play, stop, and reset an audio file through simple keyboard commands. It uses the javax.sound.sampled library to handle audio file input and playback.

Features

•	Play: Play the audio file.
•	Stop: Stop the audio playback.
•	Reset: Reset the audio to the beginning.
•	Quit: Stop playback and exit the program.
Requirements

•	Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
•	A supported audio file (e.g., .wav).
•	The current code is set to play a file named take.nas. Ensure your file is in a supported format (like .wav), or convert the file if necessary.
•	An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or a simple Java environment to compile and run the program.
Supported Audio Formats

•	.wav
•	.au
•	.aiff
If the file is in an unsupported format (such as .mp3 or .nas), you will encounter an UnsupportedAudioFileException. Convert the file to a compatible format like .wav before running the program.
